This Theatre Management Software System is a Java-based simulation of essential theater operations, including ticket booking, seating arrangement, scheduling, and amenities management. It was developed with a focus on modular design and system decomposition to reflect real-world organizational workflows. 

Throughout development, AI tools (specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT) were used to assist in planning the software architecture, improving code clarity, debugging, and drafting documentation. These tools served as support for brainstorming and refining system components, while all implementation decisions and logic were written manually. The system operates via a text-based command line interface and showcases skills in object-oriented programming, logic simulation, and clean code practices. 

Future updates will focus on integrating AI and data analysis techniques, such as predictive analytics on seating behavior. For example, the system could be expanded with AI models that analyze booking patterns to recommend optimal seat configurations, suggest dynamic pricing, or forecast low-attendance shows based on historical data and user trends. These enhancements will help transition the software into a more intelligent system that adapts to real-time audience data and improves theater resource management over time.
